# PnP-Net
 A python implementation of PnP-Net model

PnP-Net is a model for camera pose estimation, a hybrid model that used classical LM method and deep learning network. 
This code is solely implemented on my own based on the paper [PnP-Net: A hybrid Perspective-n-Point Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04626.pdf)
If there is any mistake or error, please let me know. 

(The data for in this repo is a synthetic data, and it has few samples for checking trainer.py)
