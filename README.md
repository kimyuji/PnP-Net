# PnP-Net
## A python implementation of PnP-Net model

PnP-Net is a model for camera pose estimation, a hybrid model that used classical LM method and deep learning network. <br>
This code is solely implemented on my own based on the paper [PnP-Net: A hybrid Perspective-n-Point Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04626.pdf) <br>
If there is any mistake or error, please let me know.

(The data for in this repo is a synthetic data, and it has few samples for checking trainer.py)
